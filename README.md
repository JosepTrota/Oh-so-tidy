# Hello!
## Welcome to my first, flamant, flamboyant, fancy, fmagnificent **TIDY REPO**!

***

> I know, I know, it is small, and the title and this readme so far are not looking very employable... *but*... I'm planning to order ALL my repos and github files sometime this week (wish me luck)

In this repo you can find the code used to **merge** some messy data together and **clean it** afterwards.


We used the health for all data, that was spread through 4 files of different type and format, and also used some self searched data about pollution levels in Paris.


This was so far back in time that doesn't seem to be hard anymore, but at the time it was a challenge.

God knows github is not very beginner friendly. Maybe I can give it utility points though.

### But yeah, cool, in order to demonstrate that I can take things very seriously, at least I'm giving some effort in the creation of the readme.

> When my employers look at this file it will be **drastically** changed. So enjoy it while it lasts!
