# Hello!
## Welcome to my first, flamant, flamboyant, fancy, fmagnificent **TIDY REPO**!

***

I know, I know, it is small, and the title and this readme so far are not looking very employable... *but*

I'm planning to order ALL my repos and github files sometime this week (wish me luck)

***

God knows github is not very intuitive, at least in the beginning. I can give it utility points though.

***

### But yeah, cool, in order to demonstrate that I can take things very seriously, at least I'm giving some effort in the creation of the readme.

> When my employers look at this file it will be **drastically** changed. So enjoy it while it lasts!
