# Hello!
## Welcome to my first, flamant, flamboyant, fancy, fmagnificent **TIDY REPO**!

***

> I know, I know, it is small, and the title and this readme so far are not looking very employable... *but*... I'm planning to order ALL my repos and github files sometime this week (wish me luck)

***

## Main info about the data in here

***


In this repo you can find the code used to **explore** the Sakila database, **train** a model to infer the ratings of a film using the description and **save** the vectorizer, the tf_transformer and the model in appropiate labeled folders afterwards using **pickle**.


We used the Sakila database extracted from mySQL through a query engine and then worked with the data:
* Convert ratings into a binary category with a function
* Got rid of nulls
* Chunked all the descriptions in tasty word bits and dummified them
* We split the data into X and y, train and test, yadda yadda yadda
* Trained a logistic regression model and run it
* Use Pickle to save them
* Enjoy

Fun times indeed.

God knows github is not very beginner friendly. Maybe I can give it utility points though.

### But yeah, cool, in order to demonstrate that I can take things very seriously, at least I'm giving some effort in the creation of the readme.

> When my employers look at this file it will be **drastically** changed. So enjoy it while it lasts!
